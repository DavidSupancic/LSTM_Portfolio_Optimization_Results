# LSTM_Portfolio_Optimization_Results

Each image pair (e.g., img1) shows the results of my code applied to different asset combinations using a specific loss function.

Example:
img1 - Assets: Gold, SPY, ... | Loss function: Sharpe ratio

The naming and ordering of image pairs correspond to different runs or experiments, each potentially using distinct asset sets and optimization criteria.


img1 - XLK, XLF, XLE, XLV, XLI, XLY, XLP, XLU, XLB, Gold, Real estate, Long-term bonds
img2 - SPY, Gold, Real estate, Long-term bonds
